### Overview

This hack is a 1st attempt to test my romhacking capabilities and route design. I was a beginner at tricks when I came up with this so it should be completable by most. Some intermediate+ tricks however might reward some players with shiny missiles!! 

And it is rather linear, yes.

This hack includes some unique item locations (nothing hard required is hidden/hard to find but I suggest you look around *cough cough main quarry*), water changes, and new objects added to support the route.

The path created is intentional and any use of OoB is discouraged. Warp to start is also disabled as it shouldn't be needed. 

Expected completion time: 2-4hrs

### Difficulty

**Overall** - beginner to intermediate

**Combat** - fairly vanilla combat with the need for knowledge of enemy weakpoints without visors.

**Tricks** - no major tricks, some slope jumps, some beginner scan dashes recommended to traverse magmoor quickly, some tight jumps in lower mines (vanilla but dangerous), one damage run detailed below.

**Damage Runs** - one major damage run ~halfway through the hack. Save located before and after. Ample E-tanks provided in prior areas. May require some beginner scan dashes to cross vanilla rooms quickly. Heat dmg is reduced to make this "close" even with poor movement.
