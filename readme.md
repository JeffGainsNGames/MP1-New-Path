### Overview

This hack is a 1st attempt to test my romhacking capabilities and route design. This hack includes some unique item locations (nothing hard required is hidden/hard to find), water changes, and new objects added to support the route.

The path created is intentional and any use of OoB is discouraged. Warp to start is also disabled as it shouldn't be needed.

Expected completion time: 2-4hrs

### Difficulty

**Overall** - beginner to intermediate

**Combat** - fairly vanilla combat with the need for knowledge of enemy weakpoints without visors.

**Tricks** - no major tricks, some beginner scan dashes required to traverse magmoor quickly, some tight jumps in lower mines, one damage run detailed below.

**Damage Runs** - one major damage run ~halfway through the hack. Save located before and after. Ample E-tanks provided in prior areas. Will require some beginner scan dashes to cross vanilla rooms quickly. Heat dmg is reduced to make this "close" even with poor movement.
